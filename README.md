# DID-Manipulating-Trojan

In order to reduce time-to-market and overall cost of microprocessors used in embedded systems and Internet-of-Things sectors,
System-on-Chips (SoCs) started housing third party Intellectual
Property(IP) blocks. Due to the high design cost, many chip manufacturing industries rely on outsourcing design automation, fabrication, and testing of integrated circuits. Functional and logical security of such devices is at stake due to the involvement of untrusted
third parties during various phases of chip manufacturing. Malicious circuits, known as Hardware Trojan (HT) implanted inside a
genuine blueprint design can go untraceable during the verification
and testing phase of SoC. HTs can alter the system behavior to
deploy attacks such as information leakage, unauthorized access,
functional errors, and delay-of-service
